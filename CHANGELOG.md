# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-18)

- Separate operational COMPLETE (exit 0) from native assurance. Completion
  requires all declared outputs retained, every exact required check passed,
  observed cleanup and validated, durably finalized evidence. Incomplete work stays nonzero.
- Revalidate retained identities after preparation cleanup, match factory
  nodes to exact distinct child records, and withhold success headlines until
  the invocation's completion boundary.
- Introduce leaf record schema 0.3 and factory schema 0.2 with independent
  execution and assurance fields. Old/unknown records fail closed for new
  handoffs; historical evidence is never rewritten. COMPLETE does not pass
  strict VERIFIED-only admission.
- Present Contract / Checks / Evidence consistently in default and verbose
  modes, with PASS/FAIL labels, artifact/check counts, copyable paths and
  one pre-execution local-access/cost disclosure. Retain routine narration
  and checker details without hiding live progress or failure diagnostics.
- Publish fresh v0.4.0 native bundles from this release source. Historical
  v0.3.2 downloads and the pinned demo remain unchanged with UNPROVEN/21
  outcomes; no v0.3.2 binary, asset or manifest is reused.
- Put factory work before consent: list every declared artifact and planned
  check with literal counts and execution-matching contract names. Disclose
  local access, package installation and cost once, immediately before the
  default-No prompt. Preview evidence paths describe future storage, not an
  existing record; `--plan` remains free of execution disclosure and consent.
- Give the six software-factory hero checks outcome-oriented names so consent
  states what each command proves, while keeping commands and validation
  semantics unchanged.
