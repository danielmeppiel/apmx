# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (unreleased)

- Separate operational COMPLETE (exit 0) from native assurance. Completion
  requires all declared outputs retained, every exact required check passed,
  observed cleanup and validated, durably finalized evidence. Incomplete work stays nonzero.
- Revalidate retained identities after preparation cleanup, match factory
  nodes to exact distinct child records, and withhold success headlines until
  the invocation's completion boundary.
- Introduce leaf record schema 0.3 and factory schema 0.2 with independent
  execution and assurance fields. Old/unknown records fail closed for new
  handoffs; historical evidence is never rewritten. COMPLETE does not pass
  strict VERIFIED-only admission.
- Present Contract / Checks / Evidence consistently in default and verbose
  modes, with PASS/FAIL labels, artifact/check counts, copyable paths and
  one pre-execution local-access/cost disclosure. Retain routine narration
  and checker details without hiding live progress or failure diagnostics.
- Preserve published v0.3.2 downloads and historical demo behavior. This
  source change does not rebuild or release native assets.
