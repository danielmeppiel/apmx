# Changelog

## 0.4.1 - 2026-09-18

- Make the native release smoke fixture follow the current Copilot event and
  presentation protocol: public progress, completion and tool observations are
  proven from the retained transcript without requiring successful leaf
  narration to appear before native completion.
- Make transcript presentation assertions portable across LF and CRLF output
  streams while preserving byte-identical retained transcript and finalization
  checks.
- Publish v0.4.1 as the patch release candidate. No GitHub release or native
  assets were published for v0.4.0; its immutable public tag remains the source
  record of the failed release-preparation candidate.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-18)

- Separate operational COMPLETE (exit 0) from native assurance. Completion
  requires all declared outputs retained, every exact required check passed,
  observed cleanup and validated, durably finalized evidence. Incomplete work stays nonzero.
- Revalidate retained identities after preparation cleanup, match factory
  nodes to exact distinct child records, and withhold success headlines until
  the invocation's completion boundary.
- Introduce leaf record schema 0.3 and factory schema 0.2 with independent
  execution and assurance fields. Old/unknown records fail closed for new
  handoffs; historical evidence is never rewritten. COMPLETE does not pass
  strict VERIFIED-only admission.
- Present Contract / Checks / Evidence consistently in default and verbose
  modes, with PASS/FAIL labels, artifact/check counts, copyable paths and
  one pre-execution local-access/cost disclosure. Retain routine narration
  and checker details without hiding live progress or failure diagnostics.
- Prepare fresh v0.4.0 native bundles from this release source. Release
  preparation failed before publication, so no v0.4.0 GitHub release or native
  assets exist. Historical v0.3.2 downloads and the pinned demo remain unchanged
  with UNPROVEN/21 outcomes; no v0.3.2 binary, asset or manifest is reused.
- Put factory work before consent: list every declared artifact and planned
  check with literal counts and execution-matching contract names. Disclose
  local access, package installation and cost once, immediately before the
  default-No prompt. Preview evidence paths describe future storage, not an
  existing record; `--plan` remains free of execution disclosure and consent.
- Give the six software-factory hero checks outcome-oriented names so consent
  states what each command proves, while keeping commands and validation
  semantics unchanged.
